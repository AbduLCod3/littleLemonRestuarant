# Little Lemon Restuarant

I'm diving into React Native for the first time, working on a cross-platform app focused on a restaurant. 
The app's main features include menu viewing, order placement, and payment processing. 

While the final output represents my own effort, I'm following instructions to build the app. If I encounter challenges, solutions are readily accessible. Moreover, I am watching an instructor break down similar code and its purpose before I start each related task for the app.
